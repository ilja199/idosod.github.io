  <p>Today world political system is the most difficult if to compare with previous centuries and millennium. Although, in some countries state leaders don’t have any significant control over their countries, they remain to be the main influential figures in the foreign policy of the country. So, let's consider what kind of personal qualities should one head of state have?</p>
  <p>First of all, a state leader should be highly motivated in his country life, so with a drive and determination he have to try to improve a life of inhabitants of the state. He must have strong leadership qualities and be an effective communicator by itself, as he is the most important person in the country.</p>
  <p>It is important to look always formal. This applies to both appearance and behavior in general, because journalists are just looking for an occasion to make fun of some incident. That may greatly shake the reputation of the head of state, so he have to control everything that he is doing or saying.</p>
  <p>A state leader position involve frequent travel around the world for attendance at international meetings and summits, so the knowledge of various cultural features and traditions is preferable. As well meetings with representatives of other countries takes a lot of time.</p>
  <p>Despite all the difficulties, leaders get a comprehensive remuneration package, including a car with a driver, a house, high salary, outfits and many other privileges. It’s not the easiest work, so the pay for it is high.</p>
